</div>


When you think about software outsourcing destinations, Bangladesh probably isn't the first name that comes to mind. But it should be.

Tucked between India, Myanmar and **Bay of Bengal**, this country of 170 million people has built a diverse software ecosystem with companies doing remarkable work—from government systems that serve millions to products used by British Council and ACCA for global examinations.

Let me walk you through the companies, what they actually do, and the business models that work.

## The Industry at a Glance

**Current State (2024-2025):**
- **$1.3 billion+** in annual ICT exports
- **$840 million** in official software export revenue (FY 2023-24)
- **4,500+** registered IT/software companies
- **400,000+** professionals employed
- Exports to **80+ countries** worldwide

**Growth:**
- From $26 million in 2008 to over $1 billion today—a **40x increase** in 16 years

## Why Bangladesh's Software Industry Exists

Bangladesh has pulled off something remarkable over the past fifteen years. The government made a deliberate bet on IT services as an export industry, offering tax breaks, building infrastructure, and pushing digitization across public services. The result? An industry that went from essentially nothing to generating over a billion dollars annually.

Here's what makes the model work: Bangladesh offers highly skilled English-speaking developers at competitive rates that deliver exceptional value. A senior software engineer in Dhaka might earn 100,000+ taka monthly (roughly $900+)—professional compensation that enables access to world-class engineering talent at reasonable investment levels.

For American or European companies, the value proposition is compelling. You're not "saving money"—you're accessing talented engineers who bring strong technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and dedication to building quality products. The time zone works perfectly too—Bangladesh is well-positioned for both European and US clients, enabling real-time collaboration when needed.

This created multiple distinct types of software businesses beyond just traditional outsourcing. Let's break them down.

## The Complete Business Model Breakdown

Looking across Bangladesh's software landscape, you can categorize companies into **seven main business models**—not just the two or three most people talk about:

| Business Model           | % of Industry | Description                                                                                     | Top Companies                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pure Outsourcing**     | 40%           | Provide developers/teams to international clients on time-and-materials or fixed-price projects | Brain Station 23, BJIT, Cefalo, Enosis, Vivasoft   |
| **Government Contracts** | 15%           | Specialize in public sector projects, national infrastructure, digitization initiatives         | Datasoft, Tiger IT, OrangeBD, Tappware, SoftBD     |
| **Product Companies**    | 12%           | Build and sell own software (SaaS, licenses, marketplace products)                              | BDTask, Ollyo, REVE Systems, NerdDevs              |
| **Hybrid Models**        | 8%            | Combine client work with own products for diversification                                       | Brain Station 23, NerdDevs, Kaz Software           |
| **Tech Startups**        | 10%           | VC-backed growth companies building consumer/enterprise platforms                               | bKash, Pathao, ShopUp, Chaldal, Shikho             |
| **Embedded Systems**     | 5%            | Firmware, IoT, hardware-software integration for electronics/devices                            | Samsung R&D, BJIT Embedded, Teton Electronics      |
| **Freelance-to-Company** | 6%            | Companies that started as freelancers on Upwork/Fiverr and grew into agencies                   | Hundreds of small agencies across Dhaka/Chittagong |
| **Digital Services**     | 4%            | Software + SEO, content marketing, social media management                                      | Bizcope, Red Sparrow Digital, HYPE DHAKA           |

Let's dive into each category with the major players you need to know.

## The Government Contract Giants

### Datasoft Systems Bangladesh Limited

- **Website:** https://datasoftbd.com
- **Founded:** 1998
- **Employees:** 300+
- **Certification:** CMMI Level 5 (first in Bangladesh)

Datasoft was the first mover in Bangladesh's software industry, and they focused on something many others avoided—government contracts. That turned out to be prescient.

Walk into any government office in Bangladesh and there's a decent chance you'll encounter Datasoft's work. They built the national ID system, the e-passport system, biometric registration systems for multiple agencies, voter registration platforms, and border control infrastructure. These aren't small projects—they're nation-building scale, often worth tens or hundreds of millions of taka.

Their flagship commercial product, **Microfin 360** (launched 2008), targets microfinance institutions and NGOs. Given Bangladesh's massive microfinance sector (pioneered by Grameen Bank), this was smart positioning. The product has since expanded across the region to Nepal, Bhutan, Canada, and India.

What Datasoft understood early was that government contracts, while bureaucratic and sometimes slow-paying, provide stable long-term revenue. Once you're embedded in a ministry's infrastructure, replacement becomes politically and technically difficult. That stickiness matters.

**Salary Range:** 30,000-180,000 taka/month+ for software engineers

### Tiger IT Bangladesh Limited

- **Website:** https://www.tigerit.com
- **Founded:** 2006
- **Employees:** 100+
- **Specialization:** Biometric and identity management

If Datasoft is the generalist in government contracts, Tiger IT is the specialist. They focus almost exclusively on security, identity management, and biometric systems—the stuff that requires security clearances and deep technical expertise.

This is the company government agencies call when they need fingerprint identification systems, automated fingerprint identification systems (AFIS), facial recognition, or secure document management. Their client list includes defense and security agencies, which means many of their projects aren't publicly discussed.

Tiger IT has carved out a defensible niche. Biometric systems aren't something you can easily commodity outsource—they require specialized knowledge, security protocols, and trust.

**Salary Range:** 90,000-180,000 taka/month+ for software engineers

### The Government Contract Controversy

No discussion of Bangladesh's software industry is complete without addressing the elephant in the room: government procurement controversies.

Between 2019 and 2024, the a2i (Aspire to Innovate) project—a major government digitalization initiative supported by UNDP—procured software through 46 separate contracts. An investigation found that just four companies received 23 of those 46 contracts (50%).

The companies were:
- **Tappware Solutions:** 6 contracts
- **SoftBD:** 6 contracts
- **Business Automation Limited:** 6 contracts
- **OrangeBD** (Orange IT): 5 contracts

Allegations emerged of a "syndicate" where procurement conditions were allegedly tailor-made to benefit specific companies. This isn't unique to Bangladesh—government tech procurement is notoriously prone to corruption globally. But it illustrates why some companies focus intensely on government contracts while others avoid them entirely.

## The International Outsourcing Leaders

### Brain Station 23

- **Website:** https://brainstation-23.com
- **Founded:** 2006
- **Employees:** 800+ (700+ software engineers)
- **Certifications:** CMMI Level 3, ISO 9001, ISO 27001
**Projects Completed:** 2,000+

If you had to pick one company that represents Bangladesh's software ambitions, it's probably Brain Station 23. They're the largest by headcount, the most diverse in services, and have the strongest international presence with offices in the USA, UK, Australia, Nigeria, and across Europe and the Middle East.

Brain Station 23 does everything. Banking and fintech (they built CityTouch for City Bank, which processes over $3 billion in transactions), e-commerce platforms (the Shwapno supermarket system), ERP implementations (official Odoo partner), learning management systems (Moodle partner with their own Proctoring Pro product), AI and machine learning solutions, AR/VR, mobile apps—the list goes on.

Their client roster reads like a who's who: PayPal, Nissan, British Telecom, Unilever, City Bank, AB Bank, HSBC Bangladesh, MetLife, Grameenphone, Robi, BAT Bangladesh, and multiple pharmaceutical companies.

What makes Brain Station 23 interesting is their **hybrid model**:
- ~50% international outsourcing
- ~30% own product development (like Intellifriend, their AI time-tracking app)
- ~20% local enterprise solutions

**Salary Range:** 60,000-220,000 taka/month+ for software engineers

### BJIT Group

- **Website:** https://bjitgroup.com
- **Founded:** 2007
- **Employees:** 800+
- **Specialization:** Japanese market

BJIT took a different approach—instead of trying to serve everyone, they became the go-to partner for Japanese companies. About 80% of their work comes from Japan, with the rest split between Singapore and other markets.

This specialization makes sense. The Japanese market is huge, culturally specific, and historically underserved by South Asian outsourcing. Companies like BJIT that invest in understanding Japanese business culture, communication styles, and quality expectations can command premium rates.

**Salary Range:** 30,000-220,000 taka/month+ for software engineers

### Cefalo Bangladesh Ltd.

- **Website:** https://www.cefalo.com
- **Specialization:** Norwegian market

Like BJIT with Japan, Cefalo focused almost exclusively on Norway. They provide full-time capable developers to Norwegian businesses and have built a reputation as one of the best workplaces in Bangladesh.

The salaries reflect Norwegian client budgets:

**Salary Range:** 65,000-220,000 taka/month+ (senior engineers can earn 185,000-220,000 taka)

That senior engineer salary is exceptional for Bangladesh—roughly $1,700-$2,000/month. Competitive value for Norwegian clients while representing top-tier local compensation.

### Enosis Solutions

- **Website:** https://enosisbd.com
- **Founded:** 2010
- **Employees:** 200+
- **Focus:** US and European markets

Enosis went the American and European route, focusing on web and mobile application development, cloud solutions, and IT consulting using agile methodologies. About 70% of revenue comes from US clients, 20% from Europe, 10% elsewhere.

**Salary Range:** 50,000-220,000 taka/month+ (well-structured career ladder with clear levels)

### Vivasoft Limited

- **Website:** https://vivasoftltd.com
- **Founded:** 2010
- **Employees:** 300+ (180+ dedicated engineers)
- **Focus:** Team augmentation and offshore office setup

Vivasoft positioned themselves uniquely—instead of just doing custom development, they focus on team augmentation (providing dedicated developers to extend existing teams) and helping companies set up full offshore offices in Bangladesh.

**Salary Range:** 25,000-220,000 taka/month+ for software engineers

### Selise Digital Platforms

- **Website:** https://selisegroup.com
- **Revenue:** ~$37.9 million
- **Headquarters:** Zürich, Switzerland (with Bangladesh operations)
- **Ranking:** #2 Top Software Company in Bangladesh 2025

Selise is a global IT delivery organization with significant Bangladesh operations. They specialize in advanced computing, AI, data science, and digital platform creation. As a "Swiss tech partner for digital transformation," they bring European quality standards to Bangladeshi talent.

## The Product Companies

### NerdDevs

- **Website:** https://nerddevs.com
- **Product Website:** https://biddaan.com
- **Founded:** 2015
- **Employees:** 16+ (small but impactful)
- **Specialization:** EdTech and messaging solutions

NerdDevs represents a different model—staying small, focusing intensely on specific problems, and building both client work and own products simultaneously.

Their flagship partnership achievement is **TestReach**, an online assessment platform that ACCA (Association of Chartered Certified Accountants), British Council, CIPS, and iSQI use for global examinations. If you've taken a professional certification exam in the UK, there's a decent chance NerdDevs wrote part of the software.

They also built **Second Text**, a messaging app used in the US market that handles 4-5 million messages monthly—managing that volume reliably requires serious engineering.

**For the Bangladesh market, their major products include:**

**Biddaan** (https://biddaan.com) - Their flagship Learning Management System specifically designed for Bangladeshi & International educational institutions. It handles student tracking, progress notes, institution management, and the full administrative stack educational organizations need. The interface is multilingual, which matters—most LMS solutions are English-only, creating barriers for local schools.

**Salary Range:** 30,000-220,000 taka/month+ for software engineers

### BDTask Limited

- **Website:** https://www.bdtask.com
- **Focus:** Ready-made software products

While most Bangladeshi companies do client work, BDTask went the opposite direction—they build ready-made software and sell it globally through marketplaces like Envato.

Their product catalog includes accounting software, inventory management, POS systems, school management, hospital management, hotel management, restaurant management, HR and payroll systems—basically every business management need you can think of.

This is a different business model entirely. Instead of getting paid for hours worked or projects completed, they sell licenses—think $50-$500 per copy, with customers in Europe, North America, and Southeast Asia buying directly.

### Ollyo (MuktoSoft)

- **Website:** https://ollyo.com
- **Founded:** 2010
- **Focus:** WordPress and Joomla ecosystem

Ollyo took a similar product approach but focused narrowly on WordPress plugins, themes, Joomla extensions, and open-source tools. They're an Envato partner, meaning their products sell through Envato's massive marketplace.

Products include WordPress plugins, Joomla templates, no-code website builders, e-learning platforms, e-commerce solutions, and a free open-source icon library. Some of their work is used by thousands of websites globally.

### REVE Systems Ltd.

- **Website:** https://www.revechat.com
- **Focus:** VoIP and communications platform software

REVE Systems built telecommunications software—VoIP platforms, communication tools, and enterprise communications solutions used globally. This is highly specialized work requiring understanding of telecommunications protocols, real-time communication, and handling large-scale voice/video traffic.

**Salary Range:** 50,000-150,000 taka/month+ for software engineers

## The Freelance-to-Company Model (Hidden Giants)

This is the category nobody talks about but it's MASSIVE. Hundreds of software companies in Bangladesh started as individual freelancers on **Upwork**, **Fiverr**, **Freelancer.com**, and **oDesk** (now Upwork).

Here's how it works:
1. Developer starts freelancing on Upwork/Fiverr while in university or early career
2. Builds reputation, gets 5-star reviews, starts earning $2,000-$5,000/month
3. Gets more work than they can handle alone
4. Hires friends/junior developers
5. Registers a company
6. Continues taking contracts through platforms + direct clients

**Characteristics of these companies:**
- 5-50 employees typically
- Heavy focus on web development (WordPress, Laravel, React, Node.js)
- Strong presence on Upwork, Fiverr, Freelancer.com
- Often specialize in specific niches (e-commerce sites, real estate portals, booking systems)
- Salaries: 20,000-150,000 taka/month+ typically
- Revenue: $50,000-$500,000 annually for established agencies

**Why this model works:**
- Low barrier to entry (no sales team needed—platforms bring clients)
- International clients from day one
- Payment security through platforms
- Can build reputation faster than cold outreach

**Notable platforms used:**
- Upwork (most popular for software development)
- Fiverr (quick projects, WordPress fixes, small websites)
- Freelancer.com (competitive bidding model)
- PeoplePerHour, Guru (alternative platforms)

## Salary Comparison: The Real Numbers

Let me give you the unvarnished truth about salaries in Bangladesh's software industry. These are ranges based on current market data (2024-2025):

### By Experience Level:

| Level                             | Salary Range (BDT/month) | Salary Range (USD/month) |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| **Trainee/Intern**                | 0-15,000                 | $0-135                   |
| **Junior Developer** (0-2 years)  | 20,000-45,000            | $180-405                 |
| **Software Engineer** (2-5 years) | 50,000-80,000            | $450-720                 |
| **Senior Engineer** (5+ years)    | 100,000-220,000          | $900-1,980               |
| **Tech Lead/Principal**           | 165,000-300,000          | $1,485-2,700             |

### By Company Type:

| Company Type                                   | Junior        | Mid-Level      | Senior          |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| **Local Outsourcing**                          | 25,000-35,000 | 50,000-70,000  | 100,000-150,000 |
| **Western Outsourcing** (Cefalo, Enosis)       | 50,000-80,000 | 70,000-130,000 | 185,000-220,000 |
| **International Companies** (Optimizely, Cheq) | 70,000+       | 120,000+       | 250,000-300,000 |
| **Tech Startups** (Pathao, Chaldal)            | 65,000+       | 70,000-100,000 | 155,000-220,000 |
| **Product Companies**                          | 30,000-50,000 | 60,000-90,000  | 100,000-220,000 |

### Key Observations:

**1. The Entry-Level Reality:**
Many companies pay trainee and intern positions 0-10,000 taka monthly (effectively free or near-free labor). It's controversial but common—companies view it as paid training rather than productive work.

**2. The International Company Premium:**
Companies with international headquarters pay significantly more:
- Optimizely: Senior Software Engineer at 250,000-300,000 taka/month+
- Cheq Inc.: Senior QA Automation Engineer at 180,000-300,000 taka/month+
- Tero Labs: Engineer at 120,000-150,000 taka/month+

**3. The Startup Competitiveness:**
Local tech companies (Pathao, Chaldal) pay competitively because they compete directly with international employers for talent.

**4. Remote Work Premium:**
Engineers working remotely for international companies earn substantially more:
- ~$41,465 (average for remote software developers in Bangladesh)
- ~$46,135 (median annual salary for remote software engineers)
- That's 2-4x higher than local salaries

## What This All Means

Bangladesh's software industry has reached an interesting inflection point. The early stage of just doing outsourcing for international clients is maturing into something more sophisticated.

Companies like Brain Station 23, NerdDevs, and Selise show it's possible to move up the value chain—not just writing code someone else specifies, but building products, solving complex problems, and working with prestigious international clients. TestReach (NerdDevs' platform) being used by British Council and ACCA isn't just outsourcing—it's being the technical partner for critical global infrastructure.

The government digitalization push, despite procurement controversies, created a domestic market for software. Companies like Datasoft and Tiger IT built genuinely hard technology (national ID systems, biometric platforms) that required serious engineering.

The product companies (BDTask, Ollyo, Biddaan) demonstrate that Bangladeshi developers can compete globally in marketplaces and create solutions used by thousands of businesses and schools.

The startup ecosystem (bKash, Pathao, ShopUp, Chaldal) shows that world-class consumer platforms can be built from Bangladesh for Bangladesh—and eventually for emerging markets globally.

But challenges remain real. Salaries lag far behind international standards. A "senior" engineer in Bangladesh earning $2,000/month would be entry-level pay in the US or Europe. This creates brain drain—talented developers leave for opportunities abroad. Companies struggle to retain their best engineers once they get two-three years experience and realize their market value elsewhere.

Infrastructure issues persist. Power grid losses, internet reliability in secondary cities, and reliance on Dhaka for most operations limit growth. The skills gap in advanced technologies (AI, machine learning, blockchain) means many companies can't compete for cutting-edge work.

The procurement corruption allegations around government contracts raise questions about whether that sector is sustainable long-term without serious reform.

Still, the trajectory is impressive. From essentially nothing twenty years ago to a billion-dollar industry employing hundreds of thousands, with serious companies working on real problems for real international clients—that's meaningful progress.

## The Future: Where Bangladesh's Software Industry Is Headed

The software industry Bangladesh built over fifteen years is real, substantial, and growing. It's not Silicon Valley, and it's not trying to be. It's something different—a developing country using its advantages (cost, talent, English proficiency) to build an export industry while simultaneously digitizing its own economy.

**What to watch in 2026-2030:**

1. **AI and ML Adoption:** As global demand for AI talent explodes, Bangladesh's value proposition could drive growth—if the skills gap can be addressed

2. **Startup Exits:** Bangladesh has yet to see a major IPO or acquisition. When bKash, Pathao, or ShopUp exit, it will unlock capital and validate the ecosystem

3. **Government Reform:** If procurement becomes transparent and merit-based, government contracts could drive sustainable growth rather than creating dependencies

4. **Regional Expansion:** Bangladeshi companies are well-positioned to serve other emerging markets in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Africa

5. **Remote Work:** As remote work becomes normalized, Bangladeshi developers can work directly for international companies at international rates—reducing brain drain

6. **Product Success:** BDTask, Ollyo, and NerdDevs are showing that products can scale. More success stories here could shift the industry from services to products

7. **Freelance Professionalization:** The freelance-to-company pipeline will likely formalize, creating more sustainable agencies rather than individual freelancer outfits

The story of Bangladesh's software industry isn't just about affordable services. It's about a country leveraging its human capital to participate in the global digital economy. It's about companies like Datasoft building national infrastructure, NerdDevs powering global examinations, and Pathao transforming transportation.

It's about 400,000 professionals building their futures one line of code at a time.

That's a story worth paying attention to.
